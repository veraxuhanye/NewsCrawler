Photograph: Getty ImagesCruise was introduced to Scientology by his ex-wife, Mimi Rogers, in 1986. He has generally been reticent when talking about his beliefs, especially after the negative public reaction to his notorious 2005 interview with Matt Lauer on NBC’s Today show.He defended his stance in a 2012 interview with Playboy, saying: “What’s interesting is, if I don’t talk about my religion, if I say I’m not discussing it or different humanitarian things I’m working on, they’re like, ‘He’s avoiding it.’“If I do talk about it, it becomes, ‘Oh, he’s proselytising.’ Reviewing the whole thing and how things can be edited and misinterpreted, I decided … when I’m promoting a film, I’m not going to get caught up in anything else, and that includes all my personal things.”Going Clear: the film Scientologists don’t want you to seeRead moreScientology has come under intense scrutiny in recent years after claims of physical, psychological and sexual abuse against its followers, accusations detailed detailed in recent documentaries such as Theroux’s and Going Clear by Alex Gibney, which focused on former members of the church.The Church of Scientology and its leader, David Miscavige, deny any involvement in these sorts of abuse and instead claim that the former members were themselves guilty of abuse, and were expelled for that reason."

(File Photo)THREE BJP-ruled states told the Supreme Court on Thursday that “religion is not an anathema to the Constitution” but “a part of society”, so the courts should refrain from laying down any “straitjacket standard” on what an election manifesto can or cannot contain. Additional Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, arguing for the state governments of Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, submitted before a seven-judge bench led by Chief Justice of India T S Thakur that it was not possible to separate religion from society, and hence it was “impossible” for the courts to define yardsticks in this regard. Watch What Else Is Making News“In a multi-religious country like India, due to its very uniqueness and diversity of religion, caste, community etc, ‘religion’ is not an anathema to the Constitution… Religion is a part of the society and can always be used in any sphere of society in the country, except to the extent prohibited under the Constitution or by any statutory provision,” he submitted.The state governments said the courts cannot pre-empt, define or spell out what can be permitted in an election manifesto, adding that the Election Commission and the high courts are the competent authorities to look into the issue after the election is held. “It is, therefore, impossible to lay down any straitjacket standard as to what an election manifesto should contain or should not contain,” said Mehta. He said every case would have to be judged on its own merit, to see whether it was tantamount to “corrupt practice” as stipulated under the Representation of the People Act.Contending that there was no occasion for the Constitution Bench to seek a re-interpretation of the terms “Hindutva” and “Hinduism”, Mehta said although the court was dwelling on an interpretation of the termReligion part of society, courts can’t spell out dos &amp; don’ts of poll manifestos: BJP states to SC “religion” under Section 123 of the Representation of the People Act, the same provision also stipulates that candidates should not appeal for votes on the grounds of community and language.According to Mehta, since the provision uses the composite phrase “religion, caste, community, language” while defining “corrupt practice”, there can be no justification for treating one corrupt practice as more severe than the other, only because the expression “religion” comes into play.He argued that the concept of “separation between the Church and the State” is not used to promote any particular religion, and hence, “there is no need to enlarge its scope”. The bench asked Mehta why the state governments were bothered about the use of religion and content of political speeches. Mehta said if NGOs and activists were being allowed to intervene in the matter, state governments definitely had a stake too.Meanwhile, the Bench, which is hearing a clutch of petitions relating to use of religion in political speeches and manifestos, observed that it was perhaps not possible to chart out “dos and don’ts” of political speeches.“We are not going into the permissibility of religion in political speeches. We cannot give an exhaustive listing of ‘you can say this and you cannot say that’ in political speeches,” said the bench, when senior advocate Indira Jaising, appearing for activist Teesta Setalvad, argued that a line must be drawn and religion should be kept out of politics.The CPI(M) also intervened in the matter. Representing the party, senior advocate Sanjay Hegde submitted that the party believed in secularism and quoted its programme saying it was committed to waging an uncompromising struggle for the consistent implementation of the principles of secularism.The bench, which heard various parties represented by senior lawyers including K K Venugopal, Arvind Datar, Shyam Divan, Kapil Sibal, Salman Khurshid and Indira Jaising for six days, reserved its verdict on conclusion of the arguments.

Gender gap among Catholics as Election Day approaches,Religion News Service, ,http://religionnews.com/2016/10/27/gender-gap-among-catholics-as-election-day-approaches/," (RNS) Much has been written about the gender divide in the upcoming presidential election, but new research suggests that gap is especially wide among Catholics. Almost six in 10 (58 percent) white Catholic male voters say they would vote for GOP candidate Donald Trump compared to 38 percent of white female Catholic voters, Public Religion Research Institute reported Thursday (Oct. 27). And almost half of white Catholic women (49 percent) favor Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton while 33 percent of white Catholic men say she is their choice. Within Protestant groups of likely voters, there are narrower, but still significant, gender gaps.“The White Catholic Gender Gap.” Graphic courtesy of PRRIAmong white evangelical Protestants — the religious group that by far favors Trump — 71 percent of male voters say they support Trump compared to 60 percent of females. Within white mainline Protestantism, 54 percent of male voters favor Trump and 31 percent support Clinton. In contrast, white female mainline Protestant voters are equally divided in their support of the two candidates — at 45 percent each. While Trump is receiving sizable support from evangelicals overall, PRRI’s research shows that Clinton is receiving significant support from black Protestant (90 percent), unaffiliated (66 percent) and non-Christian (58 percent) likely voters.“The Religion Vote in the 2016 Election.” Graphic courtesy of PRRIAlmost half of white mainline Protestant voters (49 percent) favor Trump, while 39 percent support Clinton and 12 percent either favor another candidate, don’t know or refused to answer. About half of white Catholic voters (48 percent) favor Trump, with 41 percent siding with Clinton and 11 percent choosing a different response. The analysis is based on PRRI surveys from Sept. 22-Oct. 17, and has a margin of error of plus or minus 2.2. percentage points.News Wire Subscribers: This article is not available for republication.

Harvey Cox seconds Pope Francis on capitalist critique,Religion News Service, ,http://religionnews.com/2016/10/27/harvey-cox-seconds-pope-francis-on-capitalist-critique/,"Harvard Divinity School Professor Emeritus Harvey Cox wrote “The Market as God.” He is seen inside his home in Cambridge at Harvard University. Photo by Kris Snibbe/Harvard Staff PhotographerVATICAN CITY (RNS) In another step forward for Catholic-Protestant reconciliation, Pope Francis and one of America’s leading Protestant theologians agree on a major heresy: the worship of the free market. When Harvard Divinity School Professor Emeritus Harvey Cox arrived recently in Rome, he made a fast track to the Vatican to meet Pope Francis, the leader of the world’s 1.3 billion Catholics. “I was ushered to the first row of seats 15 feet from the pope’s chair,” Cox told RNS. “It was wonderful.“The Market as God,” by Harvey Cox. Photo courtesy of Harvard Divinity School“I spoke to him in Spanish. He said thank you, smiled and shook my hand.” Cox said he handed Francis a copy of his latest book, “The Market as God,” at the pope’s weekly Wednesday audience. In 2013, Francis provoked an outcry from economic conservatives with the release of his apostolic exhortation, “Evangelii Gaudium (The Joy of the Gospel),” which was widely seen as his personal manifesto. In it, Francis said the world could no longer trust “the unseen forces and the invisible hand of the market” and called for ecclesiastical renewal and compassion for the poor. Cox, who taught at Harvard for 50 years, dedicated his latest book to the pope because they share a concern about what Francis called a “deified market” that’s creating “new idols.” “This is a counterfeit religion, a heresy as opposed to traditional religion,” Cox, 87, said in Rome. “I am a Baptist, and I see this as a kind of a threat and so does the pope. “In the last 40 to 50 years the market has assumed a larger and more commanding role in our culture. It has reached an overwhelming position. It wasn’t always deified. “It was a voice in the choir, part of the culture. It was surrounded by families, communities and the nation. I’m not talking about abolishing the market, but it has escalated to a controlling level.” Cox’s visit was arranged by the Rev. Tony Currer from the Vatican body responsible for promoting Christian unity, and Cox called his encounter with the pope a kind of ecumenical breakthrough. Cox had begun writing notes for his book when he was inspired by the pope’s perspective on consumerism. “The market is enormously powerful,” Cox said. “With TV and hand-held devices, well-designed images go right inside people to their emotional center. The market also knows how to ransack religious vocabulary with products labeled ‘hope’ or ‘revelation.’ If you can relate your product to a yearning or search, it is going to make a connection.” Cox said many young Americans sense there is something wrong with the free-market system. He said they were looking for change and that is why so many were drawn to Bernie Sanders in his bid for the Democratic presidential nomination. The professor also predicted the religious right would play no decisive role in the outcome of the U.S. presidential election. “The Republican Party was always an unlikely coalition between the religious right and the country club set or upper echelon of the business community. It has fallen apart.” But Cox stressed that many people – particularly white males — who supported Donald Trump were just as disillusioned with the market as young people and wanted change. “There is something terribly wrong with how the system is functioning,” Cox said. “We still don’t have any persuasive vision. We are ready for that.” About Josephine McKenna Josephine McKenna has more than 30 years' experience in print, broadcast and interactive media.

Secularism not aloofness to religion: SC - Times of India,Times of India, ,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Secularism-not-aloofness-to-religion-SC/articleshow/55102751.cms,"Amid a high-voltage legal debate on curbing use of religion to seek votes, the Supreme Court asked on Thursday whether secularism meant complete separation of politics from religion and said it would attempt to give a pragmatic interpretation of the law dealing with using religion and caste to promote hatred during elections.| TNN | Updated: Oct 28, 2016, 00:46 ISTNEW DELHI: Amid a high-voltage legal debate on curbing use of religion to seek votes, the Supreme Court asked on Thursday whether secularism meant complete separation of politics from religion and said it would attempt to give a pragmatic interpretation of the law dealing with using religion and caste to promote hatred during elections. ""It will be difficult to accept as a proposition that a political party should have nothing to do with religion and those who have something to do with it must cease to be political parties. Can a particular political party not say it would assuage the hurt sentiments of a religious group? Will that amount to seeking votes in the name of religion?"" a seven-judge constitution bench of Chief Justice T SThakur and Justices Madan BLokur, S A Bobde, Adarsh K Goel, U U Lalit, D Y Chandrachud and L N Rao asked. ""Secularism does not mean aloofness to religion but giving equal treatment to every religion. Religion and caste are vital aspects of our public life. Can it be possible to completely separate religion and caste from politics?"" it asked. The SC bench reserved its verdict on the mode and manner in which a court should try an electoral malpractice committed to seek votes using religion, community, caste or language. The SC is also examining how to deal with a religious leader appealing to people to vote in a particular way. The court's remark on what constituted secularism came when senior advocate Indira Jaising, appearing for social activist Teesta Setalvad, argued that the SC should lay down guidelines on what would constitute a permissible speech during elections. When the debate got lively, the CJI-headed bench veered away by declaring that the task before it was not to answer or lay down guidelines on what would be a permissible speech. ""We will answer the reference for interpretation of Section 123 as well as the interplay between Sections 98 and 99 of Representation of the People Act and nothing more,"" it said. Appearing for former MP CM Sunderlal Patwa, senior advocate Shyam Divan laid bare the thin dividing line between religion, language, caste and politics in India. He read out from the constituent charter of Shiromani Akali Dal and Indian Union Muslim League to show that these parties explicitly said their basis was to further the interest of a particular religious group."
MONTGOMERY: School board approves revisions to policy on religion,Packet Online, ,http://www.centraljersey.com/news/montgomery-school-board-approves-revisions-to-policy-on-religion/article_f53a773c-9c51-11e6-bfac-67270f2854cb.html," MONTGOMERY — Prayer during classroom time, as well as organized prayer groups, will be allowed in the Montgomery Township Public School District, following the school board’s approval of revisions to the school district policy that addresses religion in public schools. The Montgomery Township Board of Education approved the revised policy at its Oct. 18 meeting. The revised policy is a state-mandated policy. This policy replaces earlier versions of the policy that were adopted in 1999 and 2005. The former policies stated that “no devotional exercises or displays of a religious character will be permitted in this district, nor shall instructional activities be permitted to advance or inhibit any particular religious sect or religion generally.” But prayer in the classroom and organized prayer groups are among the activities that will be permitted in the school district — “provided the activity is consistent with current United States Supreme Court decisions regarding the relationship between government and religion,” the newly revised policy states. The policy adopted last week recognizes that students are protected by the First Amendment of the United States Constitution and by the New Jersey State Constitution, both of which ban the establishment of religion in the schools. It also acknowledges that religion is a personal matter. The policy also stipulates that school officials “will be neutral in their treatment of religion in the school district” and that they will not show favoritism or hostility regarding religious expression. “Accordingly, devotional exercises will be permitted in the district,” it states. Those “devotional exercises” include prayer during classroom time; organized prayer groups and activities; and religious expression and prayer in classroom assignments. It also includes student assemblies and extra-curricular events; prayer ant graduation and baccalaureate exercises; devotional exercises and other prayer and/or religion-related activities. “(But) the school district will not permit an activity if the activity advances or inhibits any particular religious expression that is protected by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution,” according to the newly revised policy."
Few Americans identify with more than one religion,Pew Research Center, ,http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/10/26/few-americans-identify-with-more-than-one-religion/," While the number of Americans who were raised in homes where parents had different religions appears to be growing, relatively few think of themselves as having been brought up in more than one religion, and even fewer say they currentlybelong to multiple religions.Roughly one-in-five American adults say they were raised by two people with different religious identities â such as a mother who was a Catholic and a father who was a Protestant, or a mother who was Jewish and a stepfather who was religiously unaffiliated â according to the newest report on our Religious Landscape Study. But only about half as many (11%) say they think of themselves as having been raised in more than one religion. And just 6% say they now identify with multiple religions.Young U.S. adults are considerably more likely than older Americans to report having been raised by two people with different religions. But this trend so far has not produced a discernible increase in the number of Americans who hold multiple religious identities. Adults ages 18 to 29 are no more likely than older adults to say they think of themselves as having been brought up in more than one religion. And there is no difference across age groups in the share who say they think of themselves as currentlybelonging to multiple religions.People who say they think of themselves as having been raised in more than one religion are more likely than others to identify with multiple religions as an adult. But still, only 15% of those who say they were raised in multiple religions now say they belong to more than one religion. The standard religious affiliation questionon Pew Research Center surveys does not explicitly ask respondents whether they belong to multiple faiths. In the latest study, however, we deliberately set out to explore how much religious mixing takes place in American families and whether it is on the rise. So we asked respondents a series of questions about the religion of the main people who raised them (including, in some cases, not just parents but also step-parents, grandparents, foster parents, etc.). We also asked all respondents, explicitly, whether they think of themselves as having been raised in more than one religion, or if they now belong to more than one religion. If they said yes to either question, we posed an open-ended follow-up question, asking them to explain further.Among the survey respondents who say they think of themselves as having been raised in multiple faiths, nearly half (49% of this group, about 6% of all U.S. adults) say this means they were exposed to more than one religion, often through family members of different backgrounds. An additional three-in-ten (28%) say it means they practiced multiple faiths at one time, including by attending multiple houses of worship or observing holidays or other elements of more than one religion, such as celebrating both Christmas and Hanukkah. A smaller share (18%) say their family switched religions or churches, practicing first one faith, then another.A large share of the 6% of U.S. adults who say they currently think of themselves as belonging to more than one faith (57% of this group, or about 3% of all U.S. adults) explain that they actually practice or believe in multiple faiths at the same time. Specific explanations people in this category give include taking the view that all religions are essentially the same and attending different kinds of houses of worship. Fewer say their blended religious identity is due to changing religions or churches or to having family members of different religions."
"The politics of Jen Hatmaker: Trump, Black Lives Matter, gay marriage and more",Religion News Service, ,http://religionnews.com/2016/10/25/the-politics-of-jen-hatmaker-trump-black-lives-matter-gay-marriage-and-more/," Jen Hatmaker says her first political memory is of being at a church service and finding a voters guide in her bulletin. The pamphlet did not strike her as odd or off-putting, despite encouraging congregants to “vote straight-ticket Republican.” As she says: “The way it had always been explained to me was the Republican platform is Christian. The end.” But much has changed since Hatmaker’s childhood in blue-collar suburban Wichita, Kan. The evangelical movement in which she was raised has become more politically diverse and less willing to overtly align with one party. And Hatmaker has changed, too. She has voiced strong political opinions on her Facebook page and took time during her multicity “ Belong Tour” to criticize Donald Trump. Here, we discuss her political views, and Hatmaker does not hold back. The interview was edited for length and clarity. You said you grew up in a Republican Christian context, but what about today? Do you consider yourself a conservative or a liberal? The most honest answer is probably that I am a left-leaning moderate. I have voted for Republican candidates, I have voted for Democratic candidates. I never vote a straight ticket, ever, in any election. Speaking of voting, you’ve been critical of Donald Trump. What is it about him that bothers you as a Christian woman? I hardly know where to start. I find him absolutely, positively, thoroughly unfit for the presidency. He does not understand politics, he does not understand policy, he does not understand the world, he does not understand how our government works. I don’t believe that he has America’s best interests at heart. He lacks the diplomacy that is required of a United States president. I cannot imagine any scenario in which he could represent the American people on an international stage with any sense of integrity or diplomacy. As a believer, I’m devastated at how successful he has been in pandering to our lowest, basest selves. The selves that are willing to be openly racist. The selves that are afraid of anybody that does not fit our demographic. The selves that close our arms and our hearts to victims and vulnerable people. He has exposed the darkest corners of our human hearts and then given them free rein to live out in the open. That scares me. Then of course there’s all the low-hanging fruit that we find in the media almost every other second. His history with women and his disturbing comments. They’re not just unpresidential, they’re disgraceful. They’re disgraceful for my seventh-grader. These are not OK. Image courtesy of Thomas NelsonWho do you plan to vote for? My initial thought is vote for whoever is not Donald Trump and can win. It’s interesting, though, to watch Evan McMullin rise up right now as a conservative candidate, and I’m paying attention to that. I like him. I think he’s got a lot of integrity, and I like his policies. What about Hillary? Would you be open to voting for her? Yes. But Hillary has her share of problems too, right? That to me is where the Christian family is struggling right now, because in terms of character assassination, both of our candidates have some dirt. It has become a matter of which is worse, and it’s a terrible predicament. Politically speaking, do you support gay marriage? From a civil rights and civil liberties side and from just a human being side, any two adults have the right to choose who they want to love. And they should be afforded the same legal protections as any of us. I would never wish anything less for my gay friends. From a spiritual perspective, since gay marriage is legal in all 50 states, our communities have plenty of gay couples who, just like the rest of us, need marriage support and parenting help and Christian community. They are either going to find those resources in the church or they are not. Not only are these our neighbors and friends, but they are brothers and sisters in Christ. They are adopted into the same family as the rest of us, and the church hasn’t treated the LGBT community like family. We have to do better. If an LGBT friend of yours got married, would you attend that wedding? I would attend that wedding with gladness, and I would drink champagne. I want the very best for my gay friends. I want love and happiness and faithfulness and commitment and community. Yes. That’s an easy answer.Jen and her family starred in “My Big Family Renovation” on HGTV.  Image courtesy of Jen HatmakerAnd how would you respond if one of your children were gay? I think we would parent that child exactly the same as the rest of them. Which is to say, we would always be on their side and in their corner and for them and with them. We want for all of our kids the same thing: faithful, committed marriage and a beautiful family that is committed to God and the church. I would have the same standard across the board, no matter what. You mention faithfulness and God. Do you think an LGBT relationship can be holy? I do. And my views here are tender. This is a very nuanced conversation, and it’s hard to nail down in one sitting. I’ve seen too much pain and rejection at the intersection of the gay community and the church. Every believer that witnesses that much overwhelming sorrow should be tender enough to do some hard work here. What about that other hot-button issue? Where do you stand on abortion? I’ve always had a pro-life ethic and still do. But my pro-life ethic has infinitely expanded from just simply being anti-abortion. For me, pro-life includes the life of the struggling single mom who decides to have that kid and they’re poor. It means being pro-refugee. It means being pro-Muslim. My pro-life ethic, while still not in favor of abortion and certainly not in favor of late-term abortions, has expanded. There’s something incredibly disingenuous about a Christian community that screams about abortion, but then refuses to support the very programs that are going to stabilize vulnerable, economically fragile families that decide to keep their kids. Some Christians want the baby born, but then don’t want to help the mama raise that baby. We don’t want to provide the scaffolding for them to thrive and be successful. That, to me, makes no sense at all. You’re a mother of a multiethnic family. What are your thoughts on Black Lives Matter? I’m a supporter of Black Lives Matter, and I am deeply embedded in that conversation. I am learning so much from people of color right now, specifically my black mentors and leaders that I’ve sort of put myself under. This was not a topic I even considered 10 years ago. But now I’ve read devastating books like “The New Jim Crow”by Michelle Alexander. It’s shattering, that piece of work. Brandon and I went down to Montgomery and sat for two days under the leadership of Bryan Stevenson, who wrote “Just Mercy,”and we learned so much from a legal standpoint. This conversation is wrought with tension. But I feel like this is a big part of my task and work, probably forever. As a mother of children of color, do you fear for your children? Yes. Both of my youngest two kids are Ethiopian.I can’t tell you how many nights I have stayed up worrying, because right now, my son Ben is 13. He’s adorable. Everybody loves him. He’s funny. He’s little, and he’s not threatening, but in four years he’s going to be 17. Right now, he is afforded covering by white parents. He borrows from our privilege because we are a package deal, but in a blink he’ll be walking around this world on his own. My son is good to the core. When I think about him being viewed as criminal, dangerous, threatening, in any scenario — driving, walking, changing lanes, hanging around with his friends — I could just come unraveled. It terrifies me. I could cry my eyes out right now. With great sorrow, we have sat down and had the talk with Ben that millions of black parents have had with their sons on how to walk and talk and respond to a police officer. Because all evidence and documented research tells me that he is far more at risk to be stopped, to be pulled over, to be frisked, to be searched, to be charged, to be manhandled, to be indicted, to be sentenced. It just terrifies me for my family and for all moms and all dads who are sending their black kids out into the world.

The party filed an application for intervention, through its General Secretary Sitaram Yechury, saying it was an interested party in the case as it had considerable stake in the democratic electoral process of the country. The case is being heard by a seven-member Constitution bench. Watch What Else Is Making News“It is respectfully submitted that since this Court is considering the interpretation of Section 123(3) and (3A) of the Representation of People’s Act, the applicant, which actively participates in democratic process of this country, is seeking kind indulgence of this Court to present its views in the interest of justice,” the petition said.“The applicant herein is an interested party in the civil appeal as it has a considerable stake in the democratic elctoral process of this country,” it said.The CPI(M), in its plea, also submitted that it believed in secularism and quoted its Programme saying it was committed to wage an “uncompromising struggle” for the consistent implementation of the principles of secularism.“While defending the right of every religious community -whether it is the majority or the minorities, as well as those who have no faith in any religion to believe in and practice any religion or none at all, the Party should fight against all forms of intrusion of religion in the economic, political and administrative life of the nation and uphold secular and democratic values in culture, education and society,” the plea quoted the Party Programme as saying.The apex court had on Wednesday raised the question whether seeking of votes on the basis of religion, caste or tribe would amount to “corrupt practice” under the election law.In its petition to the apex court, the CPI(M) said “the threat to the secular foundations has become menacing with the rise of the communal and fascistic RSS-led combine and its assuming power at the Centre. Systematic efforts are on to communalise the institutions of the state, the administration, the educational system and the media.”The CPI(M) said “the growth of majority communalism will strengthen the forces of minority communalism and endanger national unity” and is fraught with serious consequenses for democracy and secularism in the country. Social activist Teesta Setalvad had earlier sought to intervene in the matter with an application stating that religion and politics should not be mixed and a direction be passed to de-link religion from politics.

"Shared religious beliefs in marriage important to some, but not all, married Americans",Pew Research Center, ,http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/10/27/shared-religious-beliefs-in-marriage-important-to-some-but-not-all-married-americans/," Shared religious beliefs in marriage important to some, but not all, married Americans By David MasciLeave a commentAt a time when American society has become less religious, many people still say shared religious beliefs are an important ingredient for marital success. But married adults point to other factors, such as shared interests and even sharing household chores, as bigger keys to a successful marriage.Nearly half of all married adults (47%) say sharing religious beliefs with one’s spouse is “very important” for a successful marriage, according to the newest reportfrom Pew Research Center’s Religious Landscape Study. Perhaps not surprisingly, nearly two-thirds of those married to someone from the samereligious tradition (64%) take this view, compared with just 24% of those married to someone who is affiliated with differentreligions and only 17% of those in marriages between one religiously affiliated spouse and one who is unaffiliated.But, overall, larger percentages of Americans rank other factors higher as key ingredients to a successful marriage. We asked respondents how important each of seven factors (including sharing religion) is to marital success. Topping the list as important for adults overall is having shared interests, a satisfying sexual relationship and sharing household chores.Indeed, compared with those who value shared religious beliefs, substantially more married people (64%) say having shared interests is very important for a successful marriage. Similarly, roughly six-in-ten married Americans (61%) say a satisfying sex life is very important. Even sharing the household chores is seen as crucial by more married people (56%) than sharing religious beliefs.Overall, a slightly smaller share of married people say having children (43%) and having adequate income (42%) are very important for success in marriage than say the same about having shared religious beliefs. Meanwhile, fewer see agreement on politics (16%) as a necessary ingredient for a good marriage – a fact that may save more than few marriages during a contentious election year (although another recent Pew Research Center surveyfound that most married Clinton and Trump supporters have spouses who share their candidate preference). Although nearly half of married Americans say shared religious beliefs are very important to a successful marriage, considerably fewer (27%) say the religion of their spouse was a very important factor in their choosing who to marry. Another 21% say their spouse’s religion was “somewhat” important in their decision to wed.Again, those who are married to someone in the same religious group are more likely than religiously intermarried people to say their spouse’s faith tradition was an important factor in their decision marry them. A majority of those married to someone of the same faith say this was a very (36%) or somewhat (26%) important element in their choice, while most of those who are married to someone with a different religious identity (including people in marriages between a religiously affiliated person and a religious “none”) say their spouse’s religion was not an important factor.Fully 84% of religious “nones” married to other religiously unaffiliated people say the faith of their spouse was unimportant to them in choosing whether to get married, which makes sense, considering that just 16% of “nones” married to other “nones” express the view that shared religious beliefs are very important to a successful marriage more generally."
Bad Religion Couldn't Let This Election Go by Without a Politically Charged Tour,L.A. Weekly, ,http://www.laweekly.com/music/bad-religion-couldnt-let-this-election-go-by-without-a-politically-charged-tour-7521015," L.A. punk band Bad Religion has always been known for its socio-political lyrics, openly questioning authority at any opportunity. That’s the band’s bag; super-sweet melodies contrasting with Greg Graffin’s deadpan delivery, dressed up with often deceptively intelligent lyrics. So just imagine what the guys are making of the current political landscape as we charge towards the end of the most divisive and hate-filled presidential campaign in recent U.S. history. “The election cycle just started getting so bizarre that I called everybody and said that we need to go out on the road,” says Jay Bentley, bassist and co-founding member. “We can’t just sit by and let this happen without at least having some sort of vent.” So Bad Religion has joined forces with Against Me! and Dave Hause of The Loved Ones for the Vox Populi tour, which hits L.A. at the Hollywood Palladium on Nov. 4, just four days before the election. The aim, according to Bentley, is to get people involved in the political process who just don’t seem to care anymore. “Greg [Graffin] had made an interesting statement, that some of the songs we’re playing were written years ago with the hopes that we wouldn’t have to play them anymore because the lyrical sentiment was distressing,” Bentley says. “It’s a sad statement that here we are playing some of the same songs with the same message, because nothing’s changed.” Bentley is 52 now, and most of his bandmates are in their early 50s as well. They’re not kids anymore, but the same issues that inspired them in the 1980s drive the lyrics in 2016. Related StoriesTop 20 Punk Albums in History: The Complete List Pop-Punk Pioneers the Descendents Are Back and Raging Against Middle Age “It’s about how incredibly intolerant one man can be of another,” Bentley says. “I wake up in the morning, and any sort of news item that catches your attention can inspire. I think a lot of people have thought of Bad Religion as a political band, but I’ve always thought that we’re a socio-political band. We’re not really about politics, we’re about people, and humans. What it’s like to be a human on the planet is sort of our underlying theme.” It is disheartening that Bad Religion’s early songs are still as relevant, if not more so, today as they were when they were written, but it’s also impressive that they’ve held up so well. Bentley says that was the original intention: to write songs that would have some level of credibility ever many years down the road. That those young punks had the foresight to think like that as their careers were just kicking off is admirable. Bentley says that there are plenty of other things that haven’t changed for him or his bandmates, either. “There’s part of me that has the same cathartic release on stage that I had when I was 15,” he says. “I like to scream at the top of my lungs, and I like to jump around and get lost in the moment.” The biggest difference is the amount of work that the band members feel is necessary at this point, or that they are contractually obliged to do. They’re in the rare and luxurious position where they can pick and choose their gigs, and release a song or album when they feel the inclination. Some would say that it’s the early desperation, the fire of youth, that fuels the best punk rock, but Bentley says they’re simply now able to enjoy the fruits of their labor. “Right now, the day to day process of Bad Religion is actually quite simple,” he says. “We’re all really comfortable where we are. We don’t really have any specific drive to go and do something other than things that come up that we think are important. I know that’s a weird thing for a band to be like, ‘We’re just hanging out.’ It seems like working is what a band should be doing.” On the subject of picking and choosing their projects, Bad Religion just put out the first vinyl version of the live album 30 Years Live, six years after it was first released. Why do that now? Well, why not?

So it was a nice selection of songs that most people haven’t had the opportunity to hear live.” Whether they’re performing familiar or unfamiliar songs, Bad Religion always bring it live. And despite the fact that they don’t have to work to the degree that they once did, there’s still fire in the old bellies. The balance between “professional” and “punk rock” is always a treacherous one, but even if Bad Religion clearly know what they’re doing, don’t mistake that musical togetherness for complacency. These guys will still kick your ass from the stage, as we’ll see at the Palladium. “It is a politically driven message, and we went through the catalog and chose the songs that have important meaning,” Bentley says of their current live set. “We have political statements like ‘Man With a Mission’ or ‘You Are (The Government),’ which point at things as they are today, and we close the show with ‘Fuck Armageddon, This is Hell,’ which is us just throwing our hands up in the air and going, ‘I don’t even know what to think anymore.’” VOX POPULI TOUR: BAD RELIGION, AGAINST ME!, DAVE HAUSE| Hollywood Palladium | 6215 Sunset Blvd., Hollywood | Friday, Nov. 4, 6:30 p.m. | $61-$171 | livenation.com Bridgetown DIY Is Doing for the San Gabriel Valley What the Smell Does for Downtown L.A.

Papyrus offers nonbiblical mention of Judean kingdom in Jerusalem,Religion News Service, ,http://religionnews.com/2016/10/26/papyrus-offers-nonbiblical-mention-of-judean-kingdom-in-jerusalem/,"The document is preserved in the Israel Antiquities Authority’s Dead Sea Scrolls laboratories. Photo by Shai Halevi, courtesy of the Israel Antiquities AuthorityJERUSALEM (RNS) Israeli archaeologists have unveiled the earliest known nonbiblical Hebrew-language reference to Jerusalem, dating back to the time of the First Temple in the seventh century B.C. The reference, part of a wine-shipping order, was written in ancient Hebrew on a small piece of papyrus. It reads: “From the king’s maidservant, from Na’arat, jars of wine, to Jerusalem.” Plundered from a cave in the Judean Desert (in what is today the West Bank) by antiquities robbers, the papyrus was recovered by the Israel Antiquities Authority’s robbery prevention unit, dated and analyzed. The papyrus, or scroll, like the Dead Sea Scrolls found nearby decades ago, was preserved thanks to the Judean Desert’s extremely dry climate.With the help of volunteers during the past year the Israel Antiquities Authority has been conducting an archaeological excavation in search of ancient artifacts in the Cave of the Skulls in the Judean Desert. According to Israel Hasson, director of the Israel Antiquities Authority: “Every day robbers go into the desert in order to search out and plunder ancient documents such as the papyrus that was exposed. The state has to mobilize and allocate the necessary resources in order to embark upon a historic operation together with the public, and carry out systematic excavations in all of the Judean Desert caves.” Photo by Yoli Shwartz, courtesy of the Israel Antiquities Authority“The document represents extremely rare evidence of the existence of an organized administration in the Kingdom of Judah,” said Eitan Klein, deputy director of the robbery prevention unit. “It underscores the centrality of Jerusalem as the economic capital of the kingdom in the second half of the seventh century B.C.” Klein said that according to the Hebrew Bible, any one of three kings could have been the wine’s intended recipient. Some Israeli politicians seized on the papyrus discovery, calling it ironic that at a time when archaeologists are finding artifacts made by Jews nearly 3,000 years ago in Jerusalem and other places in the ancient land of Israel, the United Nations’ world heritage organization, UNESCO, has ratified two resolutions referring to the Temple Mount — the holiest site in Judaism and the third holiest in Islam — solely by its Arabic name, with no mention of Jewish and Christian religious or historical ties. Miri Regev, Israel’s minister of culture and sport, called the papyrus “further tangible evidence” that Jerusalem “was and will remain the eternal capital of the Jewish people.” “The Temple Mount, the very heart of Jerusalem and Israel, will remain the holiest place for the Jewish people, even if UNESCO ratifies the false and unfortunate decision another 10 times,” Regev said.

We spoke with him at the Library of Congress in Washington, DC where he explained, “The Qur’an says one of the names of God is peace. If God is peace, and if the revelation of the Qur’an to Muhammad is peace, then peace is pretty central to this book.” ###ContactDonna Williams WilliamsD@wnet.org(212) 560-8030 NoticeThe organizations and/or individuals who submit materials for distribution by Religion News Service are solely responsible for the facts in and accuracy of their materials.

'Denial' is the movie for the election season | Religion News Service,Religion News Service, ,http://religionnews.com/2016/10/26/denial-movie-deborah-lipstadt/," Remember that famous scenein “Seinfeld” where Mrs. Seinfeld browbeats Jerry into seeing “Schindler’s List”? “You have to see it!” For Helen Seinfeld, the act of seeing “Schindler’s List” was not mere entertainment; it was a moral, even religious, imperative. “Denial”falls into that same entertainment/moral category. It is the “must see” movie of this election season. “Denial” is the story of Emory University professor, Deborah Lipstadt, and how she was forced to defend herself in a libel trial in England. The British author, David Irving(portrayed in the film by Timothy Spall) brought the suit against her because she had called him a “Holocaust denier” in her book Denying the Holocaust. According to laws in the UK, in a libel suit, the “libeler” is considered guilty until proven innocent. The trial was long and draining — emotionally, financially, physically, and spiritually. Lipstadt was defended by the noted English barrister and scholar, Anthony Julius(who was Princess Diana’s divorce attorney, and the author of one of the best bookson anti-Semitism that I have ever read — and that says a lot), as well as Richard Rampton, brilliantly portrayed by the noted actor Tom Wilkinson. The film includes soul-searing footage in Auschwitz, as members of the legal team and their consultants visit the infamous concentration camp on a fact-finding mission. There is much to say about “ Denial.” After seeing it, I decided to re-read Deborah’s bookon the ordeal. First, I have a personal relationship with Professor Lipstadt, going back to my days in Atlanta (and even before), and I consider her one of my heroines. Rachel Weisz’s portrayal of Deborah deserves an Academy Award — if for nothing else than her perfect evocation of Deborah’s New York/Queens accent and cadence. It was a loving tribute to a marvelously impressive woman, who lived up to her biblical namesake(and the film shows Deborah also drawing inspiration from a statue of Boudica, the ancient British Celtic queen who led a rebellion against the Romans). Second, the movie alludes to one of the most important, but necessarily least known, aspects of the case (though it is more clearly described in Deborah’s book on the trial). That is the fact that significant American Jewish philanthropists, quietly but resolutely, “passed the hat” to help pay for Deborah’s defense. Here, the credit goes to the late, lamented Rabbi Herbert Friedmanof the Wexner Foundation, who told Deborah: “It’s time to get organized. Irving set his sights on you, but it’s the entire Jewish community he is aiming at.” Les Wexnermade it happen. And so did the American Jewish Committee, under the leadership of David Harris, the Anti-Defamation League, and the Simon Wiesenthal Center.The story of “Denial,” therefore, is the story of American Jews working together, behind the scenes, to pursue justice. It is also the story of how Emory University itself was a full partner in Deborah’s defense. Herb Friedman was right: this was not just Deborah’s fight; it belonged to the entire Jewish community. And third, this movie is absolutely crucial — and the timing of its release could not have been better and more pertinent. Why? Because it is about a very relevant theme that runs through American life today. What is the nature of David Irving’s ideology? Listen to the poemthat he taught his daughter — prompted by seeing black or racially-mixed children on the street: I am a Baby AryanNot Jewish or SectarianI have no plans to marry anApe or Rastafarian.Sound familiar? But, more than that: David Irving made s______ up. Yes, he was intellectually dishonest. But this dishonesty goes far beyond mere shoddiness and sloppiness. It is a dishonesty that has, at its core, sheer mendacity and hatred. The issue of making s_____ up goes far beyond David Irving and Holocaust deniers. It has fully migrated into UNESCO, which has denied the historical Jewish connection to sacred sites in Jerusalem. And, let the record note: the scenes of neo-Nazis confronting Lipstadt outside the trial are eerily reminiscent of the rise of the American alt-right. Go see the movie. And fight those tendencies within certain dark corners of American political life — that would emulate David Irving and his supporters.News Wire Subscribers: This article is not available for republication.

Protesters burn books as Jordan reduces religion's role in schools,The National, ,http://www.thenational.ae/world/middle-east/protesters-burn-books-as-jordan-reduces-religions-role-in-schools," Related Back in parliament, the Brotherhood is treading cautiouslyJordanian writer shot dead as he arrives at court to face charge of offending IslamJordan’s crackdown on terrorism mired in doubtISIL militants have launched a losing war on JordanJordan’s stability is key for the region, UAE analysts say Topics: Jordan AMMAN // Changes to Jordan’s school curriculum, including less religious content in textbooks, is sparking controversy across the country, with the teachers union, Islamists and parent groups objecting to what they see as an attempt to alienate students from their cultural and Islamic values. Protests have taken the form of a book-burning, a vicious social media campaign and calls for the education minister to resign.The modifications, which took effect at the start of the academic year in September, include pictures of women without head covering – considered offensive to religious Muslim Jordanians.Content touching on the coexistence of religions has also been introduced and text interpreted as promoting extremist ideology removed.Those changes, made by the education ministry for the first time in a decade are part of a wider strategy to combat radical Islam in a country struggling to prevent hate crimes such as the recent murder of a prominent secular writer who was accused of offending Islam.Education minister Mohammad Thneibat said they were intended to develop the educational system and improve analytical thinking.""They focus on the values of the nation, moderation and the core values of Islam and not like some allege,"" he said.However, the Jordan teacher’s association – the country’s teachers’ union – condemned the changes, saying they were part of a conspiracy against Islamic values, seeking to create discord and to promote normalisation of relations with Israel.The union said that Islamic references were scaled-down and Arabic names replaced. For example, in one Arabic exercise, ""Fatmeh went to Mecca"" was changed to ""Samia went to Lebanon"".In third grade Arabic books, a photo of male students in a computer lab was changed to include uncovered girls in a mixed class. Another book had a cartoon of a man sweeping the floor next to his child, in an attempt to break away from traditional gender stereotyping of women.In a chemistry book for tenth-graders, a sentence beginning with ""praise be to God"" was removed.""The total number of Quranic verses went down from 261 to 44 in Arabic language books from fifth to tenth grade,"" said Ahmad Hajaya, a spokesman from the teachers’ association. ""There are hidden powers that want to normalise the curriculum and globalise it so that the next generation will kneel down [succumb] to other cultures and to the enemy as well.""The Islamic Action Front, the Muslim’s Brotherhood political arm that won eight out of 130 seats in last month’s parliamentary elections, has also criticised the changes.""The government is justifying the changes to the curricula as a development, but it is an attempt to underestimate the intelligence of Jordanians,"" said Ali Abu Al Sukkar, the deputy head of Islamic Action Front.""We believe that scrapping religious text and Ahadeeth [the prophet’s sayings] and changing the women’s Islamic image is blatantly targeting [our] religion and culture.""Education experts who had called for a moderation of the curriculum welcomed the changes but said they did not go far enough.""The changes were largely superficial and religion remained dominant,"" said Thougan Obeidat, 74, a former deputy secretary general at the education ministry.""The issue of a woman without a head cover is blown out of proportion. She mostly appears as a cartoon and sitting with her family, so she does not need to be wearing one.""Defending the changes, he said the earlier editions of the textbooks did not even mention that there were Christians in Jordan, and included sentences that promoted extremism, or were derogatory to women. He said the new textbooks redress those imbalances.""For the first time [now], you see a church next to a mosque in the civic education books. The image of women has also improved,"" he said. Mr Obeidat said he had received death threats on social media in recent weeks because he has advocated that religious text does not need to be emphasised in all textbooks since there are already books on religion.""The students would end up studying religion in religion books, in Arabic books and civic education books and even science books,"" he said.Last month, protesters demonstrated outside the education ministry, burning textbooks and demanding that Mr Thneibat step down as education minister.Mr Thneibat said earlier this month that those who opposed the changes had based their facts on rumours and hearsay. The images and texts circulating on social media had either been doctored or taken from non-Jordanian school textbooks, he said, and did not appear in the new books.""There’s a large-scale negative campaign against the adjustment. The new school curriculum is not intended to alienate Islam,"" said the minister. Rather, it ""seeks to instil true Islamic values in the students"".Earlier this week, the union’s Mr Hajaya presented a list of their concerns to the education minister, citing examples of what the association would like to see. Among them is an Arabic passage about the benefits of swimming which the association insists should include Islamic references.For his part, Mr Thneibat insisted the teachers’ association had nothing to worry about. ""The ministry will not allow any sentence or phrase that stands against Islamic and national values,"" he said. ""We will address this if we find any,"" foreign.desk@thenational.aePages: Add your comment View all commentsRelatedBack in parliament, the Brotherhood is treading cautiously Jordanian writer shot dead as he arrives at court to face charge of offending Islam Jordan’s crackdown on terrorism mired in doubt ISIL militants have launched a losing war on JordanMore Middle East and North Africa Russia denies bombing school in Syria as UN calls for probe US and coalition ‘intercept four weapons shipments from Iran to Yemen’ Two Yazidi women awarded EU’s Sakharov human rights prize Up to 900 ISIL fighters killed in Mosul battle, US says MOST VIEWEDWorld | All From chai-wala to fashion wala for Pakistan’s blue-eyed boyProtesters burn books as Jordan reduces religion’s role in schoolsIraqi priests resurrect cross in Christian town nearly recaptured from ISILUp to 900 ISIL fighters killed in Mosul battle, US saysUS and coalition ‘intercept four weapons shipments from Iran to Yemen’Russia denies bombing school in Syria as UN calls for probeISIL extremists ‘shave beards’ as pressure builds on MosulOnce deemed a ‘monster’, Argentine teacher with Down syndrome is now an inspirationIn Iraqi Kurdistan, little regard for Baghdad alcohol banA Pakistani chai wala’s gaze creates a window into the nation’s soulMore Most Viewed Watch: Rory McIlroy adopts Taylor Made driver, sends ball ‘flying’ in ShanghaiDubai’s Dh12.5bn tunnel project likely to start next yearHuddersfield Town: A worldly club nestled into the Pennines, finding an edge on a budgetRanbir Kapoor, Tiger Shroff and Abhishek Bachchan: the struggle of Bollywood’s ‘star kids’Abu Dhabi drivers paying hundreds of dirhams a month on car cleaning to avoid finesFilm review: The Accountant is an action-hero tale that doesn’t quite add upFrom chai-wala to fashion wala for Pakistan’s blue-eyed boyUnfair of Real Madrid fans to boo a great player like Cristiano Ronaldo, and he will prove the doubters wrongCourage key for diplomacy, serial adventurer tells UAE studentsJapanese TV sensation Midnight Diner serves up a taste of hope in an uncaring world"
Religion not a factor in violent radicalization of women: report,Globalnews.ca, ,http://globalnews.ca/news/3030216/religion-not-a-factor-in-violent-radicalization-of-women-report/," A new report reveals surprising reasons young women and girls get involved with radical terrorist groups overseas.  The Status of Women report was released in Quebec City Thursday afternoon. The province hopes the report will help prevent vulnerable women from joining violent jihadist movements in Iraq and Syria. “They’re not really women who are prone to violence at all. They’re very successful at school, that was one of the elements of surprise,” Immigration Minister Kathleen Weil said. There is no specific profile for a woman who might join a terrorist organization overseas. READ MORE: Many factors can contribute to youth radicalization: Quebec reportResearchers interviewed 12 people at a prevention centre in Montreal. The women they interviewed were between 17 and 19 years old. They found a family’s economic situation didn’t play a role. Neither did ethnicity. Instead, factors included: A traumatic event in childhood, such as the death of a loved one;The type of female role models in a young woman’s life;A question of identity or wanting to belong to something.Story continues below“They don’t come from very religious families,” Weil said. “They are themselves Muslim but they’re not particularly religious.” A McGill University research group released a study with similar findings earlier this week involving 2,000 CEGEP students. That report showed that religion actually protects young people from violent radicalization.

In February, six teenagers from Montreal and Laval, two women among them, went missing. It’s suspected they went to Syria. “They are not proposing to women to engage and to fight and to engage into violence,” research manager Benjamin Ducol said. “For example, domestic tasks, the fact that they are going to be put in this kind of caring role.” Weil said the next step is to share this research with those who work with young people, namely parents and teachers, to better inform them how to prevent radicalization.© 2016 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc"

Marijuana legalization, doctor assisted suicide, and repealing a constitutional measure that prohibits state funding of religious endeavors are on state ballots across the nation. Less than two weeks away from the presidential election, these and over 150 other initiatives and proposals will be on the ballot in various states come the second Tuesday of November. Marijuana Legalization Wikipedia CommonsMedical marijuana plants.Election day 2016 will have ten ballot initiatives spread across nine states focused on the legalization of medical and recreational marijuana, a record number according to Ballotpedia.Voters in Arizona, California, Maine, Massachusetts, and Nevada will decide whether or not to legalize recreational marijuana for adults over the age of 21. Voters in Florida, Montana, and North Dakota will vote on referenda centered on legalizing marijuana for medicinal purposes. Arkansas voters will have two measures centered on marijuana, known as Issue 6 and Issue 7, which have similar yet different results if passed. Issue 6, if enacted, will legalize medical marijuana for 17 qualifying conditions, create a Medical Marijuana Commission, and direct tax revenue to various entities including vocational schools and technical institutes. Issue 7, if enacted, will legalize medical marijuana for 56 qualifying conditions and allocates tax revenue for providing low-income patients with medicinal marijuana. Should both Issue 6 and Issue 7 receive the necessary number of votes to pass, whichever Issue got the most ""yes"" votes will be enacted. Public Funding for Religious Purposes (Photo: Reuters/Jon Herskovitz)A Ten Commandants monument is seen in a fenced-off section of Oklahoma State Capitol grounds in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, September 30, 2015. The Republican Party of Oklahoma has offered a home to a Ten Commandments monument soon to be removed from Capitol grounds for violating state law, saying its teaching are espoused by the party, officials said on Thursday.Oklahoma voters will be deciding whether or not to repeal a state constitutional amendment that bars public money going to religious endeavors. Known as State Question 790, the referendum seeks to repeal Article 2, Section 5 of the Oklahoma constitution. ""No public money or property shall ever be appropriated, applied, donated, or used, directly or indirectly, for the use, benefit, or support of any sect, church, denomination, or system of religion, or for the use, benefit, or support of any priest, preacher, minister, or other religious teacher or dignitary, or sectarian institution as such,"" reads the section.The debate over the section is tied to a recent state supreme court decision that ruled against the display of the Ten Commandments on state capitol grounds, which cited Article 2, Section 5 as justification. Supporters of SQ 790 include Oklahoma City Archbishop Paul S. Coakley, who takes especial issue with the section's historic linkage to anti-Catholic sentiment. ""What's worse is that if Section 5 were ever strictly applied in the way some anti-religion groups have asked it to be, it would be devastating to Catholic and other religious hospitals,"" stated Coakley.""It is a 'Blaine Amendment,' one of a series of state constitutional provisions that were designed to exclude Catholics from providing religious education and from public life more generally. Repealing Section 5 would remove this black mark on Oklahoma's history."" Critics of the repeal effort include the Oklahoma chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, which denounced SQ 790 as ""a reckless attempt to weaken the religious liberty protections guaranteed by the Oklahoma Constitution."" ""This ballot measure is an affront to principles of religious liberty that have been with us since our nation's founding and were so fundamental that the founders of our state saw fit to enshrine in our own constitution,"" stated the ACLU of Oklahoma.Physician-Assisted Suicide (Reuters/Shannon Stapleton)Colorado voters will determine whether or not to approve a ballot measure that would allow for physician-assisted suicide under certain circumstances. Known as Proposition 106 or ""The End of Life Options Act,"" if passed the measure would legalize assisted death for terminally ill patients who have been given less than six months to live. ""To be eligible, the patient must be at least 18 years old, determined mentally capable by two physicians, and able to communicate an informed decision,"" explained Ballotpedia.""Receiving aid-in-dying drugs would require one written request, witnessed by at least two other persons, and two oral requests. The measure would also allow a physician to prescribe the lethal drug to a terminally ill patient under certain conditions."" Proponents argue that the measure allows for people to die with dignity and avoid undue suffering while critics argue that the measure devalues human life and has been shown in other states to be poorly implemented. ""Organizations who advocate for the disabled are especially against the measure because the disabled community is especially targeted by this measure,"" said Jeff Hunt, director of the Centennial Institute at Colorado Christian University, to the Daily Signal.""With doctor-assisted suicide, there is no oversight or review from an outside party. The only oversight or review that occurs is from the doctor who is administering the death."" Sponsored Watch Your Favorite Christian Films, 24/7. Click Here To Start Your Free Trial Today"
Religious people find it harder to understand the world – study,Telegraph.co.uk, ,http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/2016/10/26/religious-people-find-it-harder-to-understand-the-world--study/," eople with religious beliefs have a poorer grasp of the physical world than their non-believing counterparts, a new study claims. Researchers from the University of Helsinki surveyed 258 people about their beliefs, and whether they thought ""there exists an all-powerful, all-knowing, loving God."" Respondents were also asked to complete tasks including matching rotated images together, and solving mechanical and physics-based problems. The study, published in Applied Cognitive Psychology, concluded that believers were less scientifically knowledgeable – evinced by their propensity to agree with statements such as “flowers are able to think” and “stones feel the cold”. They were also more likely to struggle with solving physical tasks. Parody U.K. Reporter Jonathan Pie Compares Religion and PoliticsPlay!03:26 Researchers claim their results show that supernatural beliefs correlated with “low systemizing, poor intuitive physics skills, poor mechanical ability, poor mental rotation, low school grades in mathematics and physics, poor common knowledge about physical and biological phenomena, intuitive and analytical thinking styles, and in particular, with assigning mentality to non-mental phenomena.” Study authors Marjaana Lindeman and Annika Svedholm-Häkkinen suggest that, when people don’t understand the physical world, they tend to apply human characteristics to the wider universe, “resulting in belief in demons, gods, and other supernatural phenomena”. A 2008 surveyby researchers at Ulster University concluded that people with higher IQs were less likely to believe in God. Psychology professor Richard Lynn told the Times Higher Education magazine: ""Why should fewer academics believe in God than the general population? I believe it is simply a matter of the IQ. Academics have higher IQs than the general population. Several Gallup poll studies of the general population have shown that those with higher IQs tend not to believe in God."" • 'God is not just for the stupid' say Christianity's clever people"
